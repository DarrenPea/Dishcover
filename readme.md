### Problem and proposed solution
Busy professionals often have demanding schedules with long work hours, meetings, and other commitments. As a result, they may not have the time or energy to plan meals, go grocery shopping. They, therefore, face challenges in meal planning and minimising food waste.    
Solution: To solve the issue above, our app, Dishcover, is extremely time saving as it allows users to input available ingredients and receive personalised recipe suggestions, which streamlines the meal planning process, saving busy professionals valuable time and effort. Our app also links to grocery stores like FairPrice. Thus, busy professionals can easily order the ingredients they need for home-cooked meals, saving money compared to eating out and time. Our app is also aimed at reducing food waste by keeping track of expired food, as it is one of the leading reasons for food wastage. 

### Features
There are 5 main features implemented in Dishcover, the generation of recipes based on user's leftover ingredients, expiry date tracking system, creating their own recipes and sharing within the community, saving recipes and a wallet that enables voucher redemption at the supermarket.
It is also accompanied with a professionally designed UI to attract users.
